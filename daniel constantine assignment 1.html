<h1>My Profile</h1>
<br><h3>Personal Information:</h3>
<br>Hi my name is Daniel Constantine I am a student at RMIT University. 
<br>My student email is s3875199@student.rmit.edu.au and my student number is s3875199. 
<p>I was born in Australia and have lived here for most of my life. I spent two years living and working in the United Kingdom. I have completed part of a medical science degree before switching to I.T. I enjoy cycling in my spare time, I once rode my bike from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Madrid in Spain over a 5-week period. This trip was over 3000km, I had a great time and learnt how to preserve through difficult times. </p>

<br><h3>My Interest in I.T. </h3>
<br><p>I do not have a background in I.T. but I would like to start a career in this field. I am mainly interested in working in the I.T. industry because it offers a highly transferable skill set between different countries. I am looking forward to working and building an I.T. career whilst living abroad. I am interested in becoming a developer. No particular event sparked my interest in I.T. I have always found I.T. an interesting and rapidly developing field which has great potential to shape the progress of humanity. </p>
<p>I chose to study at RMIT University because I work irregular shifts which can start at any time from very early in the morning until very late at night any day of the week. RMIT University allows me to complete my studies 100% online. </p>
<p>After completing my studies at RMIT University I expect to have broad knowledge of a range on different areas in I.T. I also expect to specialize in a small number of areas giving me the competitive skills to launch a career in I.T. </p>
<br><h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<br><p>My ideal job is to become a full stack senior software developer. Here is an example of a position currently advertised on <a href="https://www.seek.com.au">www.seek.com.au</a></p>
<br><img src="https://github.com/thsghfd/Assignment1/blob/master/job.jpg?raw=true">
<br><p>Here is a link to the add: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50583839?type=standout#searchRequestToken=0612d0a0-b276-49fc-bc17-e6aa741999c5">Senior Full Stack Developer</a></p>
<p>This position is for a senior full stack developer. This job is appealing to me because I would be working as part of a team which would be responsible for the full development lifecycle of the software being developed. As a full stack developer, I would be required to have knowledge of a number of programming languages including but not limited to: C, Java, JavaScript and Python. Being a full stack developer will mean that I will be required to have skills both on the front end and back end of the development process. This role also requires cloud-based experience giving Amazon Web Services as an example, requiring integration testing of completed products. This role also requires applicants to have a strong desire to work with and as part of a team. The final requirement is demonstrating strong spoken and written communication skills.</p>
<p>Currently I have limited knowledge of C, Java, JavaScript and Python only what I have briefly learnt through my studies or in my own time. I have a basic working knowledge of AWS and other cloud-based platforms through the personal development of my own web-based store. I have extensive experience working within a team through my work in hospitality as well as team-based projects at school and university. I feel I have adequate written and spoken communication skills which I have gained through school, university and a lifetime of communicating in English.</p>
<p>To pursue a career as a senior software developer I will need to obtain much stronger skills in a variety of programming languages. I hope to obtain most of this through my studies at university. But I will also need to hone my skills through my own private studies using online courses, video tutorial and challenges. Through my studies at university I will also get the opportunity to work on team projects specifically related to I.T. which will give me additional experience working in a team environment. My communication skills should also improve via written and oral assessment during my time at university. </p>
<br><h3>Personal Profile </h3>
<br><h4>Results from an online Myers-Briggs test:</h4>
<br><img src="https://github.com/thsghfd/Assignment1/blob/master/myers.jpg?raw=true">
<br><h4>Results from an online learning style test – Auditory/Visual/Tactile</h4>
<br><img src="https://github.com/thsghfd/Assignment1/blob/master/visual%20learning%20style.jpg?raw=true">
<br><h4>Big 5 Personality Test </h4>
<br><img src="https://github.com/thsghfd/Assignment1/blob/master/5%20big%20personality.jpg?raw=true">
<br><p>The results of the Myers-Briggs test concluded that my personality type is a logician, this personality type is known for thinking about different theories and being a very logical person. This means as part of a team I will likely contribute by analysing the team's different ideas and thinking logically about how we could implement those ideas. When forming a team, I should join together with other people which would complement my personality, by displaying strength in areas where I display weakness. Logician’s lack sympathy, are absent minded and dislike rules and guidelines.</p>
<p>The learning style test results show I am a visual learner. This means I learn information best by reading text or by looking at pictures and diagrams. In a team environment to achieve optimum results I would prioritize communicating with other team members using written communication rather than spoken. When forming a team, I would probably achieve the best results if my other team members were also visual learners.</p>
<p>The next test was the big 5 personality test. The results for this test show that I scored lower in extroversion and agreeableness with an average score for intellect/imagination with higher scores in emotional stability and consciousness. The results for this test show that as part of a team I will be careful and diligent and emotionally stable. As part of a team I will be open to new experiences and other people's ideas, but as a team member I may be shy and critical. When forming a team, I must make sure to make an effort to be more extraverted and agreeable.</p>
<br><h3>Project Idea</h3>
<br><p>A free to use website with two main functions, the first function which connects a variety of real estate websites specifically for renters, real estate agents and owners of properties looking for tenants. This project seeks to simplify the rental process by displaying all available properties for rent. The second main function of this platform will not only unify all available websites which are advertising properties for rent but allow past, current and potential future tenants to connect with each other. This project will allow past, current and potential future tenants of properties to ask questions and share information about the property.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this idea comes from my own experience and frustrations searching and inspecting rental properties. Currently there are multiple major websites which real estate agents, property owners and tenants must use to advertise or find properties. Major sites include: realestate.com.au, domain.com.au, property.com.au, allhomes.com.au, rent.com.au gumtree.com.au and facebook.com.au on top of these major websites are then dozens of websites for each individual real estate company and dozens of websites for each individual property developer. This project seeks to combine the listings of all these websites into once easy to access location. The second advantage of this website is to allow online communication between owners, real estate agents and tenants. Currently the only way to get information on a property is by looking at the photos posted on the property listing and reading the embellished description written usually by the real estate agent.</p>
<p>This project is a free to use renting real estate website combining all listings from all the current major real estate websites. The data for all current listings could be scraped from these websites such as realestate.com.au and domain.com.au. Although this will be extremely convenient and beneficial, the real power behind this website we be the active user base. The website will consist of two main groups of users: the first group will be real estate agents/companies, property developers and property owners, the second group will be past, current and potential future tenants for the properties listed by the first group. Users who create an account will be able to be verified from the property manager or property owner linking them to a property which them currently live in or have lived in. Any user can ask a question about a property (such as what is the street parking like? How busy is the communal swimming pool? Does this property have a large amount of noise from traffic? Is there a nice bakery nearby?) and if a user has been verified, they may choose to answer a question about this property. Users may also request photos of different parts of the property or photos from different angles then what is displayed on an advertisement for the property. Verified users will also have the ability to rate real estate agencies or property owners leaving a comment on their experience and a star rating for other users. By publicly rating and sharing these companies' ratings it is hoped that a higher standard of practice will be achieved. Properties in larger apartment buildings will benefit most from this website as questions and requests which are not specific to the apartment but rather about the facilities or about the surrounding area will be able to be answered by all residents within the apartment building.</p>
<p>To protect user's privacy a user should register a handle rather than use their real name so as people cannot link their name to their address.</p>
<p>The tools and technologies required for this project are fairly straight forward. A website will need to be developed using any of the major programming languages such as C, Python, Java or Ruby. The website will require a database management system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite. All of these software's are open source or have free to use versions available. Once the website has been created and the database developed the website will need to be hosted before it will be functional. This can be achieved in two ways either by purchasing and setting up a server physically or by renting a server or server space from the 1000’s of hosting companies around the world.</p>
<p>To set up this project successfully a small team of experienced and skilled full stack developers will be required. A website will need to be designed, built and tested by these developers. The developers will be required to have UX skills, website programming skills, server security implementation skills database management skills. No special hardware will be required except a server to host the website.</p>
<p>If this project is successful it will save a huge amount of time and money for property owners, real estate agents and tenants. Two major problems of finding a suitable property/tenants will be solved with this project. The first is achieved by displaying all property listings on a single website. No longer will potential tenants have to sort through the dozens of websites to find a suitable property as all listing will be found in one place. The second problem which will be solved by this project is the free and fast flow of information by allowing tenants to directly ask questions and share information with past or current tenants, property owners or real estate agents. By allowing this free flow of information properties should be rented out faster, less time will be wasted by potential tenants and real estate agents by viewing properties which they are not interested in if they can get a large amount of accurate information on the property before visiting the property in person.</p>
